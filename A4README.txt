# Burger Specials GUI Application

**Student Name**: Roderick Fowler  
**Design Tools Used**: Python, Tkinter  
**Issues Encountered**: I faced difficulty resizing the window to accommodate varying content. I resolved this by using the `grid` layout manager with `sticky` options.  
**Useful Support Sources**:
